# Generate Faker

### Installing Repository
To run this program, you first need to require a pre-defined gem called Faker. To do so, create a faker.rb file and at the put require 'faker'. To call a Http verb, get you first need to require HTTParty to the program. This gets the randomly generated word. We also require json, as we are getting the data from a json file.

### Creating Methods
To create a method, you first need to create a class and then start creating the different methods in the class. The first method I created was to get the full name from the random generator, I done this by calling Faker::Name.name.These are pre-defineed methods which you can get from https://github.com/stympy/faker .

### To run the file
To run this file, call ruby with the file name .rb and it should show the results of the generator.
